### Day 1: November 22, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Refresher on Advanced CSS Tricks

**Thoughts:** Though I think I'm very much good at CSS, but still there's a lot of tricks that I find really difficult to implement. This refresher really pulls me a bit more out of a darkness.

### Day 2: November 23, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Peep into Algorithms and Data Structures

**Thoughts:** I didn't study computer science, and I think its just the coding that matters. But it so happens that deep knowledge of Algorithms and Data Structures is more important!

### Day 3: November 24, 2017

**Today's Progress**: The whole day spent on ElectronJS

**Thoughts:** Just inquisitive and curious to know if I can develope desktop apps with JavaScript, just like the way I can develop it with tkinter in python. I come across ElectronJS

### Day 4: November 25, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) Revisited

**Thoughts:** My burning aspiration of becoming a world-class developer, leads me to this SDLC concept. I have learned a lot!

### Day 5: November 26, 2017

**Today's Progress**: HTTP Protocol's in depth using ExpressJS

**Thoughts:** A must know for every web developer, this material is quite educative

### Day 6: November 27, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Today I use MochaJS. All codes written were automatically tested with it!

**Thoughts:** This Mocha is quite handy. Before, I use to test my code manually for all the expected conditions that it needs to be met, for it to pass. Mocha simplifies it all!

### Day 7: November 28, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Material Design was quite awesome.. Thanks to Google!

**Thoughts:** As a self-taught developer, I did my UI all by myself due to unavailability of designer and it looks rough, lacking all the industry best practices. I'm gonna change the status quo! Google is here to help out!
